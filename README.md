# PythonForDS
This repository keeps the sample codes and techniques to be able to reuse again in the future. All the code sample are in Python.

## Structure of the repository:
The whole repository is divided into folders which point out the core topics in Data Science. 
Basic Data Analysis folder is an introduction to the process of data wrangling -> exploratory data analysis -> model development -> model evaluation. 

ML (Machine Learning) folder covers basic types of models like classification (logistic regression, support vector machine, multi-class classification, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors), regression (linear regression) and clustering (k-Means).

NLP folder contains of the sufficient material for working with the text data from tokenization to language modelling (will be updated).

Visualization stands for the visual representation of data. Notebooks show a wide range of libraries to create the most essential types of plots. Finally, dash library is used to deploy the visuals using web server and html layout.

DL (Deep Learning) - to be updated
